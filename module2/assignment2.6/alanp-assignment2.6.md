# Cloud Engineering NTU SCTP - Assignment2.6

### Brief
The objective of this assignment is to gain a deeper understanding of AWS permissions and policies and how they can be used to secure access to AWS resources.

1: Research

    Research and investigate the concepts of AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) and the different types of permissions and policies available.
    Write a report summarizing your experience with IAM, including an overview of the permissions and policies used, any challenges encountered, and any benefits or limitations observed.
    Provide examples of how these permissions and policies can be used in a real-world scenario.

2: Hands On
> Create a new IAM user with the syntax YOUR NAME + "-temp-user" suffix e.g. luqman-temp-user.  
> Grant this new user you have created access to (i) create, view and delete EC2 instances, (ii) create and view S3 buckets only and (iii) view RDS instances only.
