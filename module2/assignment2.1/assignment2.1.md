## Group 1 members: Alif Yusri, Azmi Maniku, Andy Liew, Alan Peh
### The objective of this assignment is to gain a deeper understanding of cloud computing, hybrid computing and traditional computing and the benefits and limitations of each.

1. **Choose a specific use case (e.g. a small business, a startup, a large enterprise) and determine which computing model would be the most appropriate for that use case, providing a detailed explanation of your reasoning.
-	Newly launched e-commerce website using public cloud.**
    - Scalability
        - Ability to expand capabilities as and when itâ€™s required e.g. Event/Festive Season
    - Cost-efficiency
        - Less upfront cost for public cloud vs hybrid or on prem. Opex vs Capex model.
    - Infrastructure management
        - Cloud providers take care of hardware maintenance. Ease of management of resources from cloud console/cli/terraform/etc. All required services (VMs, Databases, Storage, etc) are consolidated with one provider.
    - Availability
        - With different Ecommerce infrastructure being hosted across different availability zones making sure there is minimal operating downtime.

2. **Compare and contrast the benefits and limitations of each model, including cost, scalability, security, and flexibility.**

1. **Write a report summarising your research, including a comparison and contrast of the different computing models and an analysis of the chosen use case.**
- For new e-commerce startups, cloud computing is the way to go. It offers:
    - unbeatable scalability to handle traffic spikes
    - keeps costs down with a pay-as-you-go model. 
    - manage the tech, often providing attractive onboarding packages for startups, boosting availability 
    - Content Delivery Network (CDN) offerings to speed up content delivery to improve user experience globally
    - provides built-in disaster recovery and back-up solutions, to ensure data protection for swift restoration in case of outages
    - enhances and innovates the e-commerce platform, via quick access to tools like AI, machine learning, data analytics and more.
    - Rapid deployment to update the e-commerce site, reducing time-to-market
- Overall, this setup is more well-rounded in terms of flexibility, cost-effectiveness, scalability, performance, ease of management and innovation-friendly compared to alternatives, making it ideal for app-first businesses in today's fast-paced digital marketplace. With cloud, e-commerce companies can easily adapt to market changes and gain valuable insights with cutting edge machine learning and AI powered services into consumer behaviour, setting themselves up for success in the competitive online retail world.
