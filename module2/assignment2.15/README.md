# Assignment 2.15 - Principles in Cloud Architecture Design - Operational Excellence    
### Group Members: Alif Yusri, Stephen Tan, Azmi Maniku, Jun Jie Wong, Alan Peh, Shafiq Hussein    

## 1. What is Cloud Architecture Design - Operational Excellence?  

Operational excellence in cloud architecture is a comprehensive approach to building efficient, reliable, and cost-effective systems. It involves automating routine tasks to reduce manual effort and errors.  
Implementing robust monitoring to identify and address issues promptly, managing scalability to ensure systems can handle fluctuating workloads, and fostering a culture of automation to drive continuous improvement.  
By prioritizing reliability, performance, and cost-efficiency, operational excellence ensures that cloud-based systems are highly available, scalable, secure, and cost-effective.  


## 2. Implementation of Cloud Architecture Design - Operational Excellence on E-commerce platform  

### Perform Operations as Code  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Define and manage infrastructure using code for consistency and automation.  
Automation Scripts: Create scripts for routine tasks to reduce manual effort.  

### Make Frequent, Small, Reversible Changes  
- CI/CD: Implement continuous integration and continuous delivery for faster deployment and testing.  

### Refine Operations Procedures Frequently  
- Post-Mortem Analysis: Conduct thorough reviews of incidents to identify root causes and improve procedures.  
- Runbooks: Create detailed runbooks for common operational tasks to ensure consistency and efficiency.  
- Automation: Automate repetitive tasks to reduce human error and improve efficiency.  

### Anticipate Failure   
- Chaos Engineering: Introduce controlled failures to test the system's resilience and identify weaknesses.  
- Disaster Recovery Plans: Develop comprehensive disaster recovery plans to ensure business continuity.  
- Backup and Recovery: Implement regular backups and test recovery procedures.  

### Learn From All Operational Failures  
- Incident Management: Establish a robust incident management process to capture and analyze incidents.   
- Knowledge Sharing: Share lessons learned from incidents across teams to prevent recurrence.   
- Continuous Improvement: Use data from incidents to identify areas for improvement and implement changes.
