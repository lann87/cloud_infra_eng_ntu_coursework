# Assignment 2.12 - Principles in Cloud Architecture Design - Reliability  
### Group Members: Alif Yusri, Stephen Tan, Azmi Maniku, Jun Jie Wong, Alan Peh, Shafiq Hussein  

## 1. What is Cloud Architecture Design - Reliability?
Cloud Architecture Design - Reliability involves structuring cloud systems for consistent performance, even during failures. This includes implementing redundancy, failover mechanisms, and fault tolerance across the architecture. Key aspects are multi-region deployment, load balancing, and automated recovery. By prioritizing reliability, businesses can minimize downtime, maintain customer trust, and protect revenue. Reliable systems also support seamless scaling and adaptability, ensuring resilient and responsive infrastructure over time.


## 2. Implementing Cloud Architecture Design - Reliability for an E-commerce Mobile-First Business  

### Multi-Region Deployment:  
- Distribute the application across multiple regions for geographic redundancy and reduced latency.

### Load Balancing and Auto-Scaling:  
- Utilize load balancing to evenly distribute traffic and implement auto-scaling to adjust resources based on demand.

### Fault-Tolerant Database Design:  
- Use multi-AZ deployments, read replicas, and automated backups to ensure data accessibility and quick recovery.  

### Monitoring and Alerting:  
- Set up comprehensive monitoring for performance metrics and system health to proactively identify and address issues.  

### Automated Recovery and Failover:  
- Develop automated processes for instance replacement and database failover to minimize downtime and manual intervention.  
- These strategies will help create a reliable cloud architecture that maintains consistent performance and user satisfaction.
