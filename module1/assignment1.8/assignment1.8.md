- Group 1 assignment1.8 group work - Alif, Azmi, Alex & Alan.

Cloud Storage Options:
-   Object storage - S3
-   File storage - EFS or FSx
-   Block storage - EBS

Pros of Cloud Storage:
```sh
-   Durability and availability - Ensures data is reliably stored and accessible
-   Scaling - Easily adjust storage capacity as needed
-   Accessibility - Access data from anywhere with internet connection
-   No need to maintain own storage infrastructure
-   Reduces on-premises hardware and management costs
```

Cons of Cloud Storage:
```sh
-   Cost considerations - Ongoing costs may accumulate, especially for large data 
    volumes
-   Compliance and legal issues - Data sovereignty and regulatory compliance can 
    be challenging
-   Network/internet dependency - Requires reliable internet connection for access
-   Vendor lock-in - With costly egress data transfe out of the cloud can be 
    expensive
-   Lack of control of data - Limited direct control over physical storage and 
    security measures
```

Group Assignment Summary:
```sh
-   Cloud storage is like renting a digital storage unit. You can store files,
    objects, or raw data blocks. It's great because it's reliable, grows with your 
    needs, and you can access it from anywhere. You don't need to buy or maintain
    your own storage equipment.
    But it's not perfect. It can get expensive if you store a lot. Some laws make
    it tricky to store certain data in the cloud. You need good internet to use it.
    Moving your stuff to a different service can be costly. Also, you can't touch 
    the actual machines storing your data.
    
-   Think of it like this: It's convenient, but you're trading some control for
    that convenience. It works well for many, but you need to think carefully about
    what you need before jumping in.
