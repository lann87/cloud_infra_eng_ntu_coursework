-   File storage - EFS or FSx
-   Block storage - EBS

Pros of Cloud Storage:
```sh
-   Durability and availability - Ensures data is reliably stored and accessible
-   Scaling - Easily adjust storage capacity as needed
-   Accessibility - Access data from anywhere with internet connection
-   No need to maintain own storage infrastructure
-   Reduces on-premises hardware and management costs
```

Cons of Cloud Storage:
```sh
-   Cost considerations - Ongoing costs may accumulate, especially for large data 
    volumes
-   Compliance and legal issues - Data sovereignty and regulatory compliance can 
    be challenging
-   Network/internet dependency - Requires reliable internet connection for access
-   Vendor lock-in - With costly egress data transfe out of the cloud can be 
    expensive
-   Lack of control of data - Limited direct control over physical storage and 
    security measures
```
