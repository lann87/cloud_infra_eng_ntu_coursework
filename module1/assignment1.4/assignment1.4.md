1. What happened? - Alif
```sh
The Marriott data breach came from Starwood network which was
jeopardized in 2014 back when Starwood was their own company,
the merger at that time did not include a smooth transition of
IT infrastructure which led to the hack being undetectable even
two years later. The hackers manage to decrypt and discover data
of 500 million guest records which includes extremely sensitive
information like credit card, passport numbers, postal codes, etc.

The hack was alerted by a security tool when it pinged a suspicious
data query by a user with admin privileges.After further investigation,
the admin account was known to be tampered by a different person than
when it was assigned to.

2. How did it happen?

```


3. What was the impact? - Alan
```sh
-   Has an immediate financial impact of a 5% drop in Marriott
    stock price, 30 mil charges incurred for data recovery purposes.
-   Massive hit on their reputation and receiving widespread
    criticism over the lapse.

Further financial impact:
-   120 million in fines from the UK information commissionerâ€™s
    office.
-   Estimated 1 billion lost in revenue due to diminished customer
    trust and loyalty.
-   A class action lawsuit requesting up to 12.5 billion in damages.

Reputation impacts:
-   Significant damage to brand trust and customer loyalty.
-   Heavy scrutiny by regulators, Security Experts and the media.

This breach had an industry wide effect of larger focus into any
future merger and acquisition, hoteliers looking into their
legacy IT infrastructure system and a general heightened
awareness in cybersecurity.

4. Who was responsible? - Alif
```sh
According to The Posts's and Times's sources which had more access
to the hack than what was made public, it is speculated to be
state-sponsored chinese hackers based on thecode and attack patterns
used in the hack such as a cloud-hosting space frequented by Chinese
hackers. Furthermore another substanstial fact is that the millions
of valuable data did not end up for sale on the dark web. 

Government sources suspect that it was a part of a broader Chinese
effort to gain extensive amounts of data on American government and
intelligence employees where Mariott is the top hotel provider for
the U.S. government and military. The bigger aim was to have a data
lake of information where big data techniques can be used to analyzed.

In Feb 2020, the US Department of Justice  formally charged four
members of the Chinese military with the 2017 attack on Equifax that
netted personally identifying  information on millions of people;
in the announcement of the indictment, the Equifax attack was
explicitly linked to the Marriott and OPM breaches as part of the
same larger operation.

5. How can we prevent this from happening again?
```sh
Treat all acquisitions and mergers as critically vulnerable until
they can be verified as secure by either in-house IT or third party
IT services.
-Ensure IT security audit is part of the merger/acquisition deal. *

Implement a defense-in-depth solution in cybersecurity with multiple
layers of protection in case one piece fails or is compromised.
-Update and install Anti-malware software on all devices. *
-Train employees about phishing attacks. *
-Install software patches regularly. *
-Enforce security policies and ensure they are known by employees. *
-Ensure encryption is properly implemented (Use latest encryption
algorithms and keep keys separate from encrypted data). *
-Make sure remote employees don't use unsecured public wifi networks.
-Ensure physical security is good (secure server rooms).

Marriot failed in all these areas.
